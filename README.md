# Team Battery Hub

In the area my team lounges around coding, we have less than chargers than developers, so we're always passing the charger around. I created this app so we could see each other's battery level. Only works using Google Chrome's battery API.

## Dependencies
* [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Bundler (Ruby Gem)](http://bundler.io/)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Installation
Once you have installed the above dependencies:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install && bundle install`
3. Run `node index.js`
4. Visit your localhost on port `8000`

If you want to pipe this through a public tunnel, use a tool like NGROK.
